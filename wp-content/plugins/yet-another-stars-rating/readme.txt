Boost the way people interact with your website, e-commerce or blog with an easy and intuitive WordPress rating system! 

== Description ==
Improving the user experience (UX) with your website is a top priority for everyone who cares about their online activity, as it promotes familiarity and loyalty with your brand, and enhances visibility of your activity.

Yasr - Yet Another Stars Rating is a powerful way to add SEO-friendly user-generated reviews and testimonials to your website posts, pages and CPT, without affecting its speed.

= How To use =

= Reviewer Vote =
With the classic editor, when you create or update a page or a post, a box (metabox) will be available in the upper right corner where you'll
be able to insert the overall rating.
With the new Guteneberg editor, just click on the "+" icon to add a block and search for Yasr Overall Rating.
You can either place the overall rating automatically at the beginning or the end of a post (look in "Settings"
-> "Yet Another Stars Rating: Settings"), or wherever you want in the page using the shortcode [yasr_overall_rating] (easily added through the visual editor).

= Visitor Votes =
You can give your users the ability to vote, pasting the shortcode [yasr_visitor_votes] where you want the stars to appear.
If you're using the new Gutenberg editor, just click on the "+" icon to add a block and search for Yasr Visitor Votes
Again, this can be placed automatically at the beginning or the end of each post; the option is in "Settings" -> "Yet Another Stars Rating: Settings".

"Gameplay", "Story", etc.

It is the vote given by who writes the review: readers are able to see this vote in read-only mode.

Remember to insert this shortcode **[yasr_overall_rating]** to make it appear where you like. You can choose to make it appear just in a single post/page or in archive pages too (e.g. default Index, category pages, etc).

It is the vote that allows your visitors to vote: just paste this shortcode **[yasr_visitor_votes]** where you want the stars to appear.

= What is "Multi Set"? =
It is the feature that makes YASR awesome. Multisets give the opportunity to score different aspects for each review: for example, if you're reviewing a videogame, you can create the aspects "Graphics", "Gameplay", "Story", etc. and give a vote for each one. To create a set, just go in "Settings" -> "Yet Another Stars Rating: Settings" and click on the "Multi Sets" tab. To insert it into a post, just paste the shortcode that YASR will create for you.

= What is "Ranking reviews" ? =
It is the 10 highest rated item chart by reviewer. In order to insert it into a post or page, just paste this shortcode **[yasr_top_ten_highest_rated]**

= What is "Users' ranking" ? =
This is 2 charts in 1. Infact, this chart shows both the most rated posts/pages or the highest rated posts/pages.
For an item to appear in this chart, it has to be rated twice at least.
Paste this shortcode to make it appear where you want **[yasr_most_or_highest_rated_posts]**

= What is "Most active reviewers" ? =
If in your site there are more than 1 person writing reviews, this chart will show the 5 most active reviewers. Shortcode is **[yasr_top_5_reviewers]**

= What is "Most active users" ? =
When a visitor (logged in or not) rates a post/page, his rating is stored in the database. This chart will show the 10 most active users, displaying the login name if logged in or "Anonymous" otherwise. The shortcode : **[yasr_top_ten_active_users]**

[Demo page for Rankings](https://yetanotherstarsrating.com/yasr-rankings/)

= Wait, wait! Do I need to keep in mind all this shortcode? =
If you're using the new Gutenberg editor, you don't need at all: just use the blocks.
If, instead, you're using the classic editor, in the visual tab just click the "Yasr Shortcode" button above the editor

= Does it work with caching plugins? =
Most def! Yasr supports these caching plugins:
* [Wp Super Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/)
* [LiteSpeed Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/litespeed-cache/)
* [Wp Fastest Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fastest-cache/)
* [Wp Rocket](https://wp-rocket.me)

= Why I don't see stars in google? =
Please be sure that if you use mostly the "yasr_visitor_votes" shortcode, you've to select "Aggregate Rating" to the question "Which rich snippet do you want to use?" in the General Settings.
If, instead, your website use mostly the "yasr_overall_rating" shortcode, you've to select "Review Rating".
Google will need some days to index the stars.
You can use the [Structured Data Testing Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/) to validate your page.
If you set up everythings fine, in 99% of cases your stars will appear in a week.
If doesn't, it's suggested to ask in a SEO oriented forum.
